SmartThings Device Handlers for the British Gas Hive Sensors

1. Add the Device Handlers to your My Device Handlers.
2. Reset the device by removing the battery, waiting 10 seconds, reconnecting, and pressing the tamper button eight times. (If it's discoverable LED will be flashing in bursts of two. If not, start again.)
3. Search for new devices through the SmartThings app and the sensor will be discovered.

Apologies about the rubbish formatting. These were developed live in the online SmartThings IDE and it's a little...special sometimes.
